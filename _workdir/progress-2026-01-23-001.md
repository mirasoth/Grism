objective: Polish and align engine/runtime specs for consistency
status: completed

## Objective

Polish specs about Grism engine and runtime to make them consistent and concise:
1. Align RFC-0008, RFC-0010, RFC-0102, and rfc-namings.md
2. Polish RFC-0001, RFC-0002, RFC-0003, and RFC-0007 naming consistency
3. Mark RFC-0008 as Frozen, RFC-0102 as Review
4. Polish RFCs 0011-0017 terminology

## Completed

### Phase 1: Engine/Runtime Specs (RFC-0008, RFC-0010, RFC-0102)

1. **RFC-0008 (Physical Plan & Operator Interfaces)**
   - Replaced "Hypergraph" product references with "Grism"
   - Fixed scan operator names: `TableScan/EdgeScan/HyperEdgeScan` → `NodeScanExec/HyperedgeScanExec`
   - Consolidated backend sections into "Runtime Requirements"
   - Added forward reference to RFC-0102

2. **RFC-0010 (Distributed & Parallel Execution)**
   - Replaced "Hypergraph" product references with "Grism"
   - Simplified Section 12 "Distributed Execution by Backend" → "Distributed Runtime"
   - Added reference to RFC-0102 for implementation details

3. **RFC-0102 (Execution Engine Architecture)**
   - Clarified Section 13 relationships: RFC-0008 defines contracts, RFC-0010 defines semantics, RFC-0102 implements both

4. **rfc-namings.md**
   - Added missing physical operators: LimitExec, RenameExec, SortExec, HashAggregateExec, UnionExec, CollectExec, EmptyExec, ExchangeExec
   - Added Runtime types: LocalRuntime, RayRuntime
   - Added Executor types: LocalExecutor, RayExecutor, ExecutionContext
   - Added Distributed concepts: ExecutionStage, PartitioningSpec, LocalPhysicalPlanner, DistributedPlanner

### Phase 2: Core Specs (RFC-0001, RFC-0002, RFC-0003, RFC-0007)

5. **RFC-0001 (Hypergraph Logical Model)**
   - Section 8: "Hypergraph uses" → "Grism uses"
   - Section 13: "Hypergraph supports" → "Grism supports"

6. **RFC-0002 (Hypergraph Logical Algebra)**
   - No changes needed - "Hypergraph" correctly refers to the data model throughout

7. **RFC-0003 (Expression System & Type Model)**
   - Already using "Grism" correctly in abstract
   - No changes needed - "Hypergraph" correctly refers to the data model

8. **RFC-0007 (Cost Model & Execution Mode Selection)**
   - Section 4: "Hypergraph supports" → "Grism supports"
   - Section 15: "how Hypergraph decides" → "how Grism decides"
